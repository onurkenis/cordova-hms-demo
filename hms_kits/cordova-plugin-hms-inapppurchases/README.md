## 1. Introduction

The Cordova Plugin code encapsulates the Huawei in-app purchases client interface. It provides many APIs for your reference or use.

The Cordova Plugin code package is described as follows:  

**src/main/com/huawei/hms/cordova/inapppurchases**: core layer, bridging InAppPurchasesSDK bottom-layer code;

**www/HMSInAppPurchases.js**: external interface definition layer, which is used to define interface classes or reference files.

## 2. Installation Guide

1. Download the Cordova In-App Purchases Plugin.

2. Add Platform To Project.

   ***`cordova platform add android`***

3. Run the following command in the root directory of the Cordova project:

   ***`cordova plugin add PATH_TO_CORDOVA_INAPP_PURCHASES_PLUGIN`***

4. Check whether the Cordova In-App Purchases Plugin is successfully added to Plugin folder in the root directory of the Cordova project.

5. Add agconnect-services.json and jks file to root directory. You can see how to create jks file in this [link](https://developer.huawei.com/consumer/en/doc/development/HMS-Guides/iap-configuring-appGallery-connect).

6. Add build.json file to your project's root.

7. Enable In-App Purchases API on AppGallery Connect.

8. Add some products on AppGallery Connect.

9. Then run the Cordova app.

    ***`cordova run android`***
